## Introduction ##
* This is a project that arose as a need after failing to find Shona Church hymns online in a format that could be imported into [OpenLP](https://openlp.org/) for live church services.
* The songs were webscrapped from the [NZIYO.COM](https://nziyo.com) webpage using [WebScrapper](https://www.webscraper.io/) to a CSV file, ["hymns.csv"](https://github.com/tapiwamaguwu/church_lyrics_project/blob/master/hymns.csv) then simple text manipulation and DataFrames were used in Python to export each Hymn to the [OpenLP 2 XML Format](https://docs.openlyrics.org/en/latest/dataformat.html).
